1--> Safe File Handling:
------------------------
When we deal with files we must set permission for every type, group of type of files.

we must set the approperiate hearders when we want sent/upload file.

For example in php:
	header('Content-type: application/pdf');//here we set the type of file that we sent.
	header('Content-Disposition: inline; filename="'. $filename . '"');//set the properties of file, the file name.
	header('Content-Length: ' . filesize($directory .$filename));//set the size of the file.
	header('Expires: 0');//the expires date
	header('Cache-Control: must-revalidate');//the option of cache control.
	header('Pragma: public');//that mean that the response may be cached by any cache.

One of Most powerful thing todo, when we want to upload/downlaod file to/from server is scan from virus, toolkit, trojans, check the extensions and replace it if necessary, check if we have executable file, check the exploits of file uploads (one of exloits of php), and check open directory listing exploit, hashing the content, encrypt, decrypt the contents, fragmented the content into many based folders, check the availble size on server before upload, hide the data of files,save the certificates on external storage.

And we must be aware of secure transfer during network.

And we must check the strong of the key that we want to encryption and decryption.
