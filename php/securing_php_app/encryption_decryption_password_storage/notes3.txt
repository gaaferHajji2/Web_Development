1--> Apache Set Up:
-------------------
If you’re using Apache , follow the steps below. If you’re using a different web server, skip this section and keep reading. Open your 
httpd-ssl.conf file in your favorite text editor.

In My LAMMP (/opt/lampp/etc/extra).

Add a VirtualHost similar to the following. It will likely closely match your existing VirtualHost for your HTTP site:
<VirtualHost *:443 >
	DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/app/htdocs"
	ServerName yourApp.com
	SSLEngine on
	SSLCertificateFile /usr/bin/ssl/yourAppSigned.crt
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/bin/ssl/yourApp.key
</VirtualHost>

Now restart Apache: (in my computer: /opt/lampp/bin)
	$ apachectl restart
or use: (if we install apache2)
	$ service apache restart

Which will usually do the trick. Try your site out with https://yourApp.com . You should be good to go!

2--> NGINX Set Up:
------------------
Open your NGINX virtual hosts file in your favorite text editor. Add a virtual host similar to the following, it should closely match your 
existing site set up:
server {
	listen 443;
	server_name yourApp.com;
	location / {
		root /path/to/your/app/htdocs;
		index index.php;
	}
ssl			on;
ssl_certificate		/usr/bin/ssl/yourAppSigned.crt
ssl_certificate_key	/usr/bin/ssl/yourApp.key
}

Now restart NGINX:
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
or use:
	$ service nginx restart
which will usually handle it.
	Try your site out with https://yourApp.com . It should be ready!
